= How does it work? =

This thirteen minute video gives you an extensive overview on how WP Plugin Info Card works.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPcU27-R6lU&rel=0]

WP Plugin Info Card lets you display plugins & themes identity cards in a beautiful box with a smooth 3D rotation effect, or in a more large and responsive layout.

It uses WordPress.org plugins API & themes API to fetch data. All you need to do is provide a valid plugin/theme ID (slug name), and then insert the shortcode in any page to make it work at once!

This plugin is very light and includes scripts and CSS only if and when required (you can force scripts enqueuing in admin settings). The shortcode may be added anywhere shortcodes are supported within your theme.

The plugin also uses WordPress transients to store data returned by the API for 12 hours (720min by default), so your page loading time will not be increased due to too many requests.

The dashboard widget is very easy to set up: you simply add as many plugins and themes as you want in the admin page and they become visible in your dashboard. Fields are added on-the-fly and are sortable via drag-and-drop.

It is perfect to keep track of your own plugins and themes!
